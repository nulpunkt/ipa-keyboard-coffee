# IPA keyboard as a JQuery plugin in Coffee script
This is a small project I did a while ago. Partly to have fun with coffee script,
partly to make something useful for people who needs to write IPA characters on 
the web.

## How to setup?
* Clone this repo
* Make sure you have Coffee script  + PHP >= 5.4 installed
* `cd js; make; cd ..`
* Run a php server `php -S localhost:8080`

Point your favorite browser to `localhost:8080` and click on an input field.
